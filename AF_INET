AF_INET is an address family that is used to designate the type of addresses
When you create a socket, you have to specify its address family, and then you can only use addresses of that type with the socket.
There is 39 other address families such as UNİX, IPX, IRDA, BLUETOOTH but it is doubtful way for such a low level
And AF_INET is the safest option over a network but there is AF_INET6 for internet Protocol v6
